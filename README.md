# web-science
WEBSCI(H) Project for University of Glasgow

Project by Scott Johnston 2323166J

To run scripts cd into web-sci and run:
##pip install -r requirements.txt

This should download all required modules and from there each script can run using python command e.g:
##python twitterstream.py

Json text files will have to be added to mongoDB database in the format stated in twitterstream.py in order to be usable
